# derpibooru-openapi

OpenAPI Spec sheets for Derpibooru.  Maintained by teward.


These are OpenAPI 3.0.3 spec sheets that are usable with Swagger UI in order 
to generate pretty documentation pages via Swagger UI.

teward was annoyed at incompleteness and lack of fully up to date API 
documentation for the Derpibooru API, so he took it upon himself to convert the 
existing API documentation at https://derpibooru.org/pages/api to an OpenAPI 
spec sheet that Swaggger-UI can display.

That is at https://apidocs.thomas-ward.net/derpibooru/ for anyone to read 
through.

Changelogs are to be tracked via the swagger-editor.yaml commit logs as those populate the other two formats.
